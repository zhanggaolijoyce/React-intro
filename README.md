I finished this project under Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/playlist/pKNqYAZ)

This is my start of learning React, I learned what React is, its advantages, what JSX is, and that can use several components to make up the whole body of a page. In addition, I learned a tool called Figma which is really useful for front-end developing~
